# Flowgorithms

A collection of flowchart-based programs and algorithms created using the Flowgorithm tool.

## 📋 About

This repository contains various flowchart implementations created using [Flowgorithm](http://www.flowgorithm.org/), a free beginner's programming language that is based on simple graphical flowcharts. Flowgorithm is an excellent tool for:
- Learning programming logic and concepts
- Creating visual representations of algorithms
- Understanding program flow and control structures
- Transitioning from flowcharts to text-based programming languages

## 🎯 What is Flowgorithm?

Flowgorithm is a graphical authoring tool that allows users to write and execute programs using flowcharts. It helps beginners understand programming concepts by visualizing the logic flow before writing actual code. The tool can also convert flowcharts into multiple programming languages including:
- C#
- C++
- Java
- JavaScript
- Python
- And many more

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To view and run the flowcharts in this repository, you'll need:
- **Flowgorithm** - Download and install from [flowgorithm.org](http://www.flowgorithm.org/download/index.html)
- Operating System: Windows, macOS (via Wine), or Linux (via Wine)

### Installation

1. Download and install Flowgorithm from the official website
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Siva-Balan-V/Flowgorithms.git
   ```
3. Open Flowgorithm application
4. Navigate to File > Open and select any `.fprg` file from this repository

## 📂 Repository Structure

```
Flowgorithms/
├── README.md           # Project documentation
└── [Flowchart files]   # .fprg files (to be added)
```

## 💻 Usage

1. Open Flowgorithm application
2. Load a flowchart file (`.fprg` extension)
3. Click the "Run" button or press F5 to execute the program
4. Use the "Step" features to debug and understand the flow
5. Export to your preferred programming language if needed

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to add your own flowchart implementations:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-algorithm`)
3. Add your flowchart files with descriptive names
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add: [algorithm name]'`)
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-algorithm`)
6. Open a Pull Request

## 📝 Best Practices

When adding flowcharts to this repository:
- Use clear and descriptive file names
- Add comments within your flowcharts to explain complex logic
- Test your flowcharts thoroughly before committing
- Follow standard flowchart symbols and conventions
