# Flowgorithms

A collection of flowchart-based programs and algorithms created using the Flowgorithm tool.

## 📋 About

This repository contains various flowchart implementations created using [Flowgorithm](http://www.flowgorithm.org/), a free beginner's programming language that is based on simple graphical flowcharts. Flowgorithm is an excellent tool for:
- Learning programming logic and concepts
- Creating visual representations of algorithms
- Understanding program flow and control structures
- Transitioning from flowcharts to text-based programming languages

## 🎯 What is Flowgorithm?

Flowgorithm is a graphical authoring tool that allows users to write and execute programs using flowcharts. It helps beginners understand programming concepts by visualizing the logic flow before writing actual code. The tool can also convert flowcharts into multiple programming languages including:
- C#
- C++
- Java
- JavaScript
- Python
- And many more

## 🚀 Getting Started

To view and run the flowcharts in this repository, you'll need:
- **Flowgorithm** - Download and install from [flowgorithm.org](http://www.flowgorithm.org/download/index.html)
- Operating System: Windows, macOS (via Wine), or Linux (via Wine)

### Installation

1. Download and install Flowgorithm from the official website
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Siva-Balan-V/Flowgorithms.git
   ```

4. Use the "Step" features to debug and understand the flow
5. Export to your preferred programming language if needed

## 🎓 Topics Covered

This collection demonstrates various fundamental programming concepts:

- **Basic I/O Operations**: Input and output handling
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- **Conditional Statements**: If-else logic, decision making
- **Comparison Operators**: Greater than, less than, equal to
- **Loop Structures**: For loops, while loops, iteration
- **Mathematical Formulas**: Circle calculations, temperature conversion
- **Modulo Operations**: Even/odd number checking
- **Sequential Logic**: Step-by-step program execution

## 🔍 Example Programs

### Temperature Converter
The `Celsius-Farenheite.fprg` program converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit using the formula: `F = (C × 9/5) + 32`

### Greatest of Three
The `Greatestof3.fprg` demonstrates nested conditional logic to determine the largest value among three numbers.

### Loop Examples
- `number1-10.fprg` - Basic loop counting from 1 to 10
- `even-numbers_between_one_to_hundred.fprg` - Loop with conditional filtering
